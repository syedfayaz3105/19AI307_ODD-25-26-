# Ex.No:3(D)    INTERFACE 

## QUESTION:
Each judge uses different criteria to score fighters. Based on points, the judge will declare “WIN”, “LOSE” or “DRAW”.
LenientJudge: WIN if diff ≥ 5, DRAW if < 5
StrictJudge: WIN if diff ≥ 10, DRAW if < 10


## AIM:
To evaluate fighters' performance using two judging standards—Lenient and Strict—and determine the outcome (WIN, LOSE, or DRAW) based on the point difference.


## ALGORITHM :
* Start the program.
* Import the necessary package 'java.util'
* Create an interface Judge with an abstract method getResult(int fighter1, int fighter2).
* Create two classes LenientJudge and StrictJudge implementing the interface and applying different scoring criteria.
* Accept points scored by two fighters from the user.
* Accept judge type from the user and invoke the respective implementation.
* Display the result as WIN, LOSE, or DRAW. 8.Stop the program.

## SOURCE CODE:
```
import java.util.*;

interface Judge {
    String decide(int p1, int p2);
}

class LenientJudge implements Judge {
    public String decide(int p1, int p2) {
        int diff = Math.abs(p1 - p2);
        if (p1 > p2 && diff >= 5)
            return "WIN";
        else if (p2 > p1 && diff >= 5)
            return "LOSE";
        else
            return "DRAW";
    }
}

class StrictJudge implements Judge {
    public String decide(int p1, int p2) {
        int diff = Math.abs(p1 - p2);
        if (p1 > p2 && diff >= 10)
            return "WIN";
        else if (p2 > p1 && diff >= 10)
            return "LOSE";
        else
            return "DRAW";
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int p1 = sc.nextInt();
        int p2 = sc.nextInt();
        int judgeType = sc.nextInt();

        Judge judge;
        if (judgeType == 1)
            judge = new LenientJudge();
        else if (judgeType == 2)
            judge = new StrictJudge();
        else {
            System.out.println("Invalid judge type");
            return;
        }

        System.out.println(judge.decide(p1, p2));
    }
}

```
